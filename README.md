## Tryunfo

Project developed at the end of block 12, in which I studied about _React Components with state, events, and forms with React_.

### How it works

The most important features of this project are:
1. The initial page, contains a form, where the user can "produce" a new card for the game.
2. In this form, the user can choose: name, description, the three attributes values, an image, the card's rarity, and if the card is the "super trunfo".
3. Since there is only one super trunfo in the game, once the user chooses one card with it, none of the next can be the super trunfo.
4. Once you click to save the card, it is redirected to another section of the page, where all the cards are stored.
5. In the store section, the user can apply three filters to find a specific card. You can filter by rarity, name, or 'super trunfo'.

Besides that, I made an additional feature, which was to initiate the page with a few cards already made. Those cards were Hotel Transylvania's themed.

> It's important to highlight that only the documents produced by me are in the repository. For some of the projects, Trybe, which is the course that I'm following, gives us some functions/objects/styling that helps us to conclude the project, so the repository may seem incomplete.
